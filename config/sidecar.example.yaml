# Destination parameters, where the sidecar will send metrics:
destination:

  # Endpoint should be a HTTP or HTTPS address that accepts
  # OpenTelemetry Metrics v0.5 (or later) over gRPC:
  endpoint: https://otlp.io:443

  # Headers are included as gRPC metadata, represented as HTTP
  # request headers when exporting metric data:
  headers:
    Access-Token: aabbccdd...wwxxyyzz

  # Attributes are applied as OpenTelemetry resources on exporter
  # metrics, which are typically treated like constant labels in
  # downstream systems:
  attributes:
    # See the well-known semantic conventions for system resources:
    # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/master/specification/resource/semantic_conventions

  # Compression format to be used, if any. Defaults to snappy:
  compression: snappy

# Prometheus configuration:
prometheus:
  # The primary HTTP endpoint:
  endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:19090

  # Location of the write-ahead-log directory.
  wal: /volume/wal

  # Skip points older than this
  max_point_age: 72h

  # Send at most this number of timeseries per request

  min_shards: 100

  # Max number of shards, i.e. amount of concurrency

  # Metrics prefix is prepended to all exported metric names:
  metrics_prefix: prefix.

# Administrative settings:
admin:
  # Listen address of the sidecar's http server (e.g., for healtchecks)
  listen_ip: 0.0.0.0
  port: 10000

  # Controls how often the health check status is updated.  This must
  # be raised for Prometheus configurations that scrape infrequently.
  # Default: 1m
  health_check_period: 20s
  # Controls the threshold ratio used to determine if the check
  # should pass or fail based on the number of succes or failure to
  # send metrics via OTLP

# Diagnostics parameters, where the sidecar will send its own diagnostic
# data.  This is structurally the same as destination, above.  If this is
# not configured and disable_diagnostics is also not set, this section
# will be auto-configured to match the primary destination.

# Filters expressed as Prometheus series expressions.  If any of these
# are configured, at least one must match for the timeseries be
# exported:
filters:
- metric{label=value}
- other{l1=v1,l2=v2}

# Metric renamings:
metric_renames:
- from: old_metric
  to:   new_metric
- from: mistake
  to:   correct

# Static metadata configures the kind of metric (counter, gauge,
# histogram, summary), the value type (int64, double), and the
# help string used for exporting metrics.  These settings override
# metadata discovered via Prometheus:
static_metadata:
- metric:     network_bps
  type:       counter
